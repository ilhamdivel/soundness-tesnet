  KYC/AML compliance automation, and enterprise security frameworks.

## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: ZeroTrust Identity
- **Category**: identity

### Description
ZeroTrust Identity addresses the critical gap between traditional banking KYC systems and Web3 identity needs. Current blockchain identity solutions either compromise privacy or lack regulatory compliance, creating barriers for institutional adoption.

Our protocol enables **Privacy-Preserving Regulatory Compliance** - allowing users to prove their identity status (verified, accredited investor, non-sanctioned) without revealing personal information. Financial institutions can onboard Web3 users while maintaining full regulatory compliance, and users retain complete privacy and control over their data.

This bridges the trillion-dollar traditional finance sector with Web3, enabling compliant DeFi access for regulated entities and sophisticated investors.

### SL Integration  
ZeroTrust Identity leverages Soundness Layer's advanced capabilities:

- **Zero-Knowledge Identity Proofs**: Using SL's ZK infrastructure to generate privacy-preserving compliance proofs without exposing personal data
- **Decentralized Identity Anchoring**: Storing cryptographic identity commitments on SL's immutable ledger for tamper-proof verification
- **Cross-Chain Identity Portability**: Utilizing SL's interoperability to enable identity verification across all connected blockchain networks
- **Secure Computation Environment**: Leveraging SL's secure execution for sensitive KYC data processing without data exposure
- **Oracle Integration**: Using SL's oracle network for real-time sanctions list updates and regulatory compliance checks
- **Governance Framework**: Building on SL's governance primitives for decentralized protocol upgrades and compliance rule updates

## Technical

### Architecture
ZeroTrust Identity uses a three-layer architecture optimized for enterprise adoption:

**Layer 1: Identity Verification Engine**
- Secure enclaves process KYC documents using homomorphic encryption
- Integration with traditional banking APIs for seamless identity verification
- Real-time sanctions screening and AML compliance checking
- Document authenticity verification using advanced ML models

**Layer 2: Zero-Knowledge Proof Generation**
- Converts verified identity attributes into ZK-SNARKs on Soundness Layer
- Generates compliance proofs (age, jurisdiction, accreditation status) without revealing underlying data
- Selective disclosure allowing users to prove only necessary attributes
- Proof aggregation for complex multi-requirement scenarios

**Layer 3: Cross-Chain Identity Registry**
- Decentralized identity registry deployed across SL ecosystem
- Smart contracts for institutional onboarding and compliance automation
- Revocation mechanisms for compromised or non-compliant identities
- Integration APIs for DeFi protocols and Web3 applications

### Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Wagmi + RainbowKit
- **Backend**: Rust (Axum) + PostgreSQL + Redis + NATS messaging  
- **Blockchain**: Soundness Layer (primary) + Ethereum + Polygon + Arbitrum
- **Storage**: Encrypted PostgreSQL for KYC cache + IPFS for public metadata + Hardware Security Modules (HSM)
- **ZK**: Circom + SnarkJS + Plonky2 for proof generation
- **APIs**: Banking partner APIs, sanctions screening APIs, document verification services

### Features
1. **Institutional KYC Bridge**: One-click identity verification for users with existing banking relationships, reducing onboarding from weeks to minutes
2. **Selective Disclosure Proofs**: Prove specific attributes (age >18, US resident, accredited investor) without revealing full identity
3. **Compliance Automation**: Smart contracts automatically enforce regulatory requirements (investment limits, jurisdiction restrictions)
4. **Identity Recovery System**: Banking-grade account recovery using social recovery and institutional attestations
5. **Real-Time Risk Scoring**: Continuous compliance monitoring with automatic flagging of high-risk transactions
6. **Enterprise Dashboard**: Institutional interface for compliance officers to manage user onboarding and monitor regulatory adherence
7. **API Integration Suite**: RESTful APIs for DeFi protocols to integrate compliance checks seamlessly
